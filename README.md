# Daemon-Dash-TeamVS-2015

The official GitHub repository for Team Victorious Secret at the Daemon Dash Hackathon 2015. This project won the second
place prize for most innovative project and the CS Department Undergraduate Event Registration System competition. See
http://daemondash.cs.umd.edu/ for more details about Daemon Dash @ Univ. of MD.

This project attempts to reimagine the previous event registration system maintained by the UMD CS Department.
The resulting effort is a more functional, user-friendly, and aesthetically pleasing to both the students, staff
administration, and the system administrators.

Utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for dynamic client-side frontend and Python/Django for the backend administration.
The team currently is planning to spend more time on this project in the future as an effort to improve the infrastructure
of the CS Department at UMD.
